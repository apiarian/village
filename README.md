# village
A small-web community server.

## Goals
- Asynchronous forums backed by plain-text files.
- Synchronous ephemeral chats.
- Minimal reading-friendly web interface.
- Pleasant experience on mobile.
- Support up to about 100 users.
- Easy maintenance.

## Principles
- Data in plain text on disk. For everything. Let's see how far we can get
  without a datapase.
- Support the needs of the small community of friends and
  commonly-interested-folks.
